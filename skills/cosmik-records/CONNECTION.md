# connections

a typed directed link between two entities (cards or raw URLs). semble renders these as edges on the public knowledge graph.

## how to write one

`semble_execute` → `connections_create`. the endpoint addresses each end by type + value:

```python
result = await call_tool("connections_create", {
    "source_type": "URL",            # "URL" or "CARD"
    "source_value": "https://example.com/paper",
    "target_type": "URL",
    "target_value": "https://example.com/follow-up",
    "connection_type": "SUPPORTS",
    "note": "optional context if the type alone isn't enough",
})
```

`source_type`/`source_value`/`target_type`/`target_value` are required; `connection_type` unset means "associated, no claim about how." card ids come from `cards_list_mine`, `cards_get_library_status`, or the result of a `cards_add_url` in the same block.

## connection types worth using

- `SUPPORTS` — source provides evidence or argument for target
- `OPPOSES` — source argues against or undermines target
- `ADDRESSES` — source answers, responds to, or directly handles target
- `HELPFUL` — source is useful for working with or understanding target
- `EXPLAINER` — source explains target
- `LEADS_TO` — source points toward target as a next step or consequence
- `SUPPLEMENT` — source adds supporting context without being primary evidence
- `RELATED` — generic association. effectively banned: if this is the honest type, the connection shouldn't exist (semantic search already covers it)

(these are the api's exact enum values — `semble_get_schema(tools=["connections_create"])` is the source of truth if this list ever drifts.)

## when not to make a connection

semble's vector search already surfaces semantically-related cards together. a connection is worth writing when the relationship is *specific and directional* — not just "these are about the same thing."

if you find yourself reaching for `RELATED` at all, the cards are already adjacent in semantic space and the connection isn't doing real work — skip it. (the library once accumulated 80+ connections that were ~90% RELATED; a janitor deleted them. don't refill it.)

## temporary Semble workaround (verified 2026-09-12)

For new connections between web sources, use URL endpoints on both sides.
Resolve a card to its source URL first. Preserve existing card-based links;
do not recreate them merely to make the listing count agree.

Three upstream defects were verified in cosmik-network/semble at
463eda035983f7d80435f690953df95cc0695493:
- ConnectionQueryService.getConnectionsForUser filters out CARD endpoints.
  Its listing is not an inventory of all your connections.
- DrizzleFirehoseEventDuplicationService.hasBeenDeleted omits connections,
  returning an error before the connection deletion handler runs.
- The ATProto ConnectionMapper writes internal card UUIDs, while the
  firehose reader recognizes CARD only by an at:// prefix.

Compare paginated PDS records with the listing, resolving endpoints before
calling anything a duplicate. Preserve a before-state and use
connections_delete for confirmed stale index entries; direct PDS deletion
alone does not clean this index. Verify both surfaces after a mutation.
The operator removed 18 stale entries through the API and verified all 14
current PDS records and CIDs unchanged. These are dated receipts, not live counts.

Semble is the first candidate for your approved open-source contribution
preparation. Load own-source for the contribution boundary. Once the upstream
fix is deployed, verify card-link visibility, record round-tripping, and
external deletion handling. Then propose retiring this workaround from the
skill through the normal bot-repository review path. A merged PR alone is
not evidence the hosted service has the fix.
