description: How to use the pdsx MCP for atproto record CRUD on arbitrary lexicons. Load this when you want to do something on atproto that doesn't have a dedicated tool — saving to a custom lexicon, opening a tangled issue, writing a leaflet comment, etc.
---

pdsx is a generic atproto MCP. it lets you do CRUD on any lexicon as long as you (a) know the NSID and (b) construct a record matching that lexicon's schema. that means you can interact with anything on atproto — tangled issues, leaflet documents, cosmik cards, calendar events — without anyone writing a per-collection tool first.

## the operations

| call | use for |
|---|---|
| `mcp__pdsx__describe_repo(repo)` | list every collection a given repo has records in |
| `mcp__pdsx__list_records(collection, repo, limit, cursor)` | paginate records in a collection |
| `mcp__pdsx__get_record(uri)` | fetch one record by AT-URI |
| `mcp__pdsx__create_record(collection, record, rkey?)` | write a new record on **your** PDS |
| `mcp__pdsx__update_record(uri, record)` | replace an existing record's value |
| `mcp__pdsx__delete_record(uri)` | delete a record from your PDS |
| `mcp__pdsx__whoami()` | confirm which DID/handle pdsx is authed as |

`create_record`, `update_record`, `delete_record` always write to **the authenticated repo** — that's you (`@phi.zzstoatzz.io`). you cannot write records into someone else's repo. you can read from any repo.

## finding the right lexicon

three ways, in order of effort:

1. **you already know the NSID.** common ones: `app.bsky.feed.post`, `network.cosmik.card`, `sh.tangled.repo.issue`, `pub.leaflet.document`, `io.zzstoatzz.phi.observation`. just call `create_record` with that collection.

2. **you know a repo that uses it.** call `mcp__pdsx__describe_repo(repo="zzstoatzz.io")` to see every collection that repo has records in — you'll often spot the lexicon you want by name.

3. **you want to read the schema before writing.** lexicon schemas themselves are stored as records under `com.atproto.lexicon.schema/{nsid}` on the lexicon owner's PDS. for `sh.tangled.repo.issue`, that means `mcp__pdsx__get_record(uri="at://did:plc:tangled-owner/com.atproto.lexicon.schema/sh.tangled.repo.issue")`. read the schema, see required fields, then construct.

## constructing a record

every record needs a `$type` field equal to the NSID, plus whatever the lexicon requires. pdsx auto-injects `$type` and `createdAt` if they're missing — but it doesn't validate the rest of your record. if you send a malformed record, the PDS rejects it with an XRPC error and you'll see the field name in the error message.

minimum example (creating a note on cosmik):

```
mcp__pdsx__create_record(
  collection="network.cosmik.card",
  record={
    "kind": "NOTE",
    "content": {"text": "the engram architecture re-derivation is structural convergence, not coincidence."}
  }
)
```

result: `{"uri": "at://did:plc:.../network.cosmik.card/3xxxxx", "cid": "..."}`

if you want a specific rkey (e.g. for `app.bsky.actor.profile/self`), pass `rkey="self"`. otherwise pdsx generates a TID.

## the consent / posting layer

pdsx will happily let you create `app.bsky.feed.post` records — but **don't post via pdsx**. the trusted posting tools (`reply_to`, `like_post`, `repost_post`, `post`) handle mention-consent allowlisting, reply-ref construction, grapheme splitting, and memory writes. raw pdsx posting bypasses all of that. use it for everything *except* posts.

## owner-gating for durable public actions

some record types are durable, public, and visible (opening an issue against someone else's repo, vouching for a maintainer, following an account, mutating a goal record). these go through the like-as-approval pattern:

1. you post a request: `"@operator, like this to authorize: i want to <do thing>"`
2. operator likes the post
3. on the next batch where their like lands, the action is authorized
4. you execute exactly the action you described — never something adjacent that happened to ride the same batch

write the request post with `post` (operator-handle is on the mention-consent allowlist, so they get notified). then do nothing until you see the like in the next notifications batch. one approval = one specific action.

## domain-specific guidance

for record types you write often, there's usually a more specific skill that walks through the schema and includes worked examples:

- **cosmik writes** (notes, urls, connections): see `cosmik-records`
- **tangled records** (issues, PRs, follows, vouches): planned
- **leaflet records** (documents, comments): planned
- **phi self-records** (goals, observations, mention-consent): planned

if no domain skill exists yet for what you want to do, you have everything you need above — find the lexicon, read its schema, construct a record, call `create_record`.
