name: phi-prompt-inspect
description: Pull the exact rendered system + user prompts phi worked from on a past agent run, via the logfire MCP. Use when investigating phi's behavior — why she said that, what her context actually contained, is a block stale or feedback-looping. Read-only, no PDS writes.
---

phi is instrumented by pydantic-ai → logfire. every `agent.run()` writes an `agent run` span whose `attributes.pydantic_ai.all_messages` carries the full conversation as sent to the model: system prompt with each dynamic block as a separate `text` part, then user / assistant / tool turns.

## the two queries

Both run via `mcp__logfire__query_run(project="phi", query=..., start_timestamp=..., end_timestamp=...)`. Project is always required. Default window is 30min; max 14d. Narrow it aggressively — phi fires an `agent run` every ~10s (notification poll), so data is dense.

**Step 1 — find the span behind a specific behavior.** `final_result` is phi's own brief string summary of what she did on that run; that's the easiest way to pick the right one out of a dense window:

```sql
SELECT span_id, trace_id, start_timestamp,
       attributes->>'final_result' AS final_result
FROM records
WHERE span_name = 'agent run'
  AND attributes->>'gen_ai.agent.name' = 'phi'
ORDER BY start_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5
```

Filter on `gen_ai.agent.name = 'phi'` to exclude sub-agents — `phi-inner-critic`, `phi-extractor`, `observation-reconciler` each fire their own `agent run` spans with short purpose-built prompts. Useful when you want them, distracting when you don't.

**Step 2 — pull the rendered prompt** once you have a span_id:

```sql
SELECT attributes->'pydantic_ai.all_messages' AS messages
FROM records
WHERE span_id = '<span_id>'
LIMIT 1
```

## structure of `pydantic_ai.all_messages`

It's an array of messages:

- **`[0]`** = system — `parts` is the array of dynamic blocks in registration order. `parts[0]` is the **static base** (`personalities/phi.md` + cross-cutting operational rules); the rest are the dynamic blocks: `[YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE]`, `[OPERATOR]`, `[NOW]`, `[OPERATIONAL HISTORY]`, `[KNOWN RELAYS]`, `[GOALS AND INTERESTS]` + `[SELF-AWARENESS]` + `[SELF STATE]`, `[RECENT OPERATIONS]`, `[DISCOVERY POOL]`, `[NEW NOTIFICATIONS]`, per-author memory (`[PHI'S SYNTHESIZED IMPRESSION OF @h]` / `[OBSERVATIONS ABOUT @h]` / `[PAST EXCHANGES WITH @h]` / `[BACKGROUND RESEARCH ON @h]`), `[RELEVANT MEMORIES — synthesized for this query]`, `[ATLAS]`, `[DOCKET]`, `[OWNED FEEDS]`, `[SEMBLE]`. See `docs/system-prompt.md` for what each one is for.
- **`[1]`** = user — the path-specific task prompt (notifications batch / cycle / reflection) plus any appended blocks: `[WORKFLOW STATE]`, `[RECENT FLOW MENTIONS]`, `[RECENT CONVERSATIONS]`, `[FIRST INTERACTION WITH @h]`, `[SERVICE HEALTH]`.
- **`[2..]`** = assistant + tool roundtrips inside the agent loop. Inspect these to see which tools phi actually called and with what arguments.

## what to look for

- **Personality dilution.** `parts[0]` should contain `phi.md` verbatim. Compare against the file.
- **Feedback loops.** Several dynamic blocks reflect phi's own past output back at her — `[SELF-AWARENESS]` (sub-agent description of recent posts), `[RECENT OPERATIONS]` (verbatim recent writes), `[DOCKET]` titles (often derived from past observations). If they're all in a register phi.md tells phi *not* to use, the model sees that register reinforced even when the constitution forbids it.
- **Block bloat.** Compare token weight of abstract rules (top of `parts[0]`) against concrete current blocks. Concrete + current usually dominates abstract + general.
- **Tool roundtrips in `[2..]`.** Watch for `recall` / `search_memory` calls and what was returned — sometimes phi's drift comes from what private memory surfaced.

## gotchas

- `agent_name` is also present in attributes (pydantic-ai's own), but `gen_ai.agent.name` is the OTel-standard key the sub-agents also set — filter on that.
- A trace can span multiple `agent run` spans (the main run plus sub-agents triggered during it). `trace_id` groups them; `span_id` identifies one.
- The JSON column accepts `->` for object access and `->>` for text extraction. Array index access (`->0`) and chaining (`->'foo'->0->'bar'`) work in DataFusion just like Postgres.

## now versus then

this skill answers "what did she read on that run" from logfire. for "what would she read right now, and how heavy is it", the operator page's context-window panel (`/operator`, data from `/api/context/budget`) weighs the next run's composed prompt in tokens — static instructions, each dynamic block, each tool definition — against the model's window, and `/diagnostic` shows the rendered text of each block. use the panel before changing the toolset or a block, and this skill when a past run needs explaining.
