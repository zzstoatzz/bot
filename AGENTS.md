phi — a bluesky bot. python + pydantic-ai + atproto + turbopuffer + cosmik/semble. fastapi for the small web surface (status pages, memory graph).

## development

- `just run` / `just dev` (hot-reload) / `just deploy` (manual fly.io deploy — CI deploys on push to main, see deployment)
- `just check` — lint + typecheck + test
- `just evals` — behavioral tests (llm-as-judge)
- `just loq-relax <file>` — relax line limit for a file. never edit loq.toml manually or compress code to fit
- work from repo root

## python style

- 3.10+ typing (`T | None`, `list[T]`)
- prefer functional over OOP
- imports at the top — no deferred imports unless circular
- never use `pytest.mark.asyncio`
- tool params: `Annotated[T, Field(description=...)]` so the LLM sees what each param does

## key architecture

- one agent loop, many entry points (notifications batch, cycle, people pass, daily reflection, market/curation/editorial passes, workflow alert). all end in `agent.run()` with different `PhiDeps`.
- **signals reach phi as context, not as commands.** a `process_*` task says what she's doing right now; the facts arrive as `[BLOCK]`s she judges. the entry-point prompts still hold ~17k chars of prose that nothing drift-checks — the least-inspected text in the repo, and where over-prescription collects (docs/patterns.md).
- actions happen as tool calls inside the run, not via structured output. the agent's return value is a brief summary string for logging.
- public actions are gated (docs/safety.md). three layers: written policies plus an independent judge before every `post` (`core/policy.py`); one `process_tool_call` guard on every MCP server (`core/mcp_guard.py`) that structurally refuses raw `app.bsky.feed.*` writes and deletes through pdsx, applies the operator override to any mutation, and logs provenance while letting reads pass; and the operator override itself (`core/override.py`) — an `io.zzstoatzz.phi.override` record on the *operator's* repo, editable at the cockpit's `/operator`, that makes phi refuse to act while it is set.
- personality is separate from operational rules. tool docstrings carry per-tool guidance, not the system prompt; a block's semantics live in that block's header, next to the labels they define.
- scheduled attention is deliberate: `thought_post_hours` fires 4 cycles/day in operator-local waking hours, and `people_pass_hours` routes one of those slots to the people pass. what phi is woken up to look at is what she writes about (docs/patterns.md).
- memory: turbopuffer namespaces (`phi-users-{handle}`, `phi-episodic`). intent state on PDS under `io.zzstoatzz.phi.*` (goals, mention consent, override, atlas, docket).
- owner-gated mutations (`follow_user`, `propose_goal_change`, `write_self`, `manage_mentionable`, `create_feed`) flow through a like-as-approval mechanism: phi posts an authorization request, owner likes it, next batch lets the action through.
- MCP servers: pdsx (atproto record CRUD, feed-writes guarded), pub-search (publication search), semble (code-mode public knowledge graph), prefect (workflow state; only when auth configured). connected via `MCPServerStreamableHTTP`, fresh per `agent.run()`.
- web grounding via tavily for recency claims (`web_search`).

## skills

two distinct namespaces — don't confuse them:

- `.tangled/workflows/deploy.yml` — CI: tests, then `flyctl deploy` on every push to main (`FLY_API_TOKEN` is a tangled repo secret). a merged pull request deploys phi, including the ones she opens against `personalities/phi.md`.
- `skills/` — **phi's runtime skills.** loaded by the agent during `agent.run()`. these are things *phi* does: `publish-blog`, `cosmik-records`, `pdsx-fundamentals`, `self-traces` (what she did, from logfire), `own-source` (what she is, from this repo via the tangled tools).
- `.claude/skills/` — **operator-facing skills.** for the human + claude code working *on* phi, not phi itself. these are things *you* do to inspect or talk to phi:
  - `phi-check` — inspect phi's health/activity via logfire, bsky, fly, PDS.
  - `devlog-to-phi` — post a message to phi from the operator's devlog account (the pdsx MCP is already authed as devlog; it's a thin record-create recipe, no script).

when you add a capability, decide which namespace it belongs to and document it here. prefer the pdsx MCP over hand-rolled scripts for any atproto write — pdsx is authenticated as the devlog account (`mcp__pdsx__whoami` to confirm).

## documentation

deeper reference in `docs/`:
- `architecture.md` — entry points, scheduling, which model runs which agent, why this shape
- `memory.md` — the four kinds of state and how they compose
- `system-prompt.md` — block-by-block reference for what's in phi's context
- `mcp.md` — MCP integration
- `safety.md` — the policy judge, the pdsx feed-write guard, the operator override, and the incident that shaped them
- `testing.md` — testing philosophy
- `patterns.md` — recurring lessons; read before "fixing" anything that looks accidental
- `observability.md` — logfire integration and its sharp edges
- `internal/cockpit.md` — the web UI (internal, operator-facing)

`CHANGELOG.md` (repo root) records what shipped and why — the reasoning that
isn't in the diff. Docs describe how things *are*; the changelog describes how
they got that way. Neither should be a status report.

`docs/system-prompt.md` is drift-checked: `tests/test_docs_sync.py` fails if an `inject_*` prompt function or a policy slug isn't mentioned there. add the row, don't weaken the test.

## deployment

this repo lives at `tangled.org/zzstoatzz.io/bot`. phi reads her own source
through the tangled MCP, so update any hardcoded repo references if it moves.

fly.io app `zzstoatzz-phi`. CI deploys on every push to main
(`.tangled/workflows/deploy.yml`: tests, then `flyctl deploy`). `just deploy` is
the manual fallback when CI is unavailable. push to both `origin` (tangled) and
the `github` mirror; the mirror is what phi's `changelog` tool reads.

`/health` returns 503 when the poller is stopped without being paused or when
no poll iteration has completed in `health_stale_after` seconds (default 30x
`notification_poll_interval`). fly's http check (30s) only stops routing to a
failing machine; fly restarts a machine when its process exits (`[[restart]]`
policy `on-failure`). so `core/watchdog.py` applies the same decision every 15s
and exits the process non-zero. the check's `grace_period` covers startup (auth,
schedule seeding, bio rewrite — about a minute observed; 60s is fly's cap) so a booting machine
is not marked failing.

secrets via `fly secrets set` or `fly secrets import` (pipe `grep ^KEY .env` into it to keep values off the terminal).
