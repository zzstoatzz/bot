"""[DISCOVERY POOL] — authors the operator has been liking lately.

A generic, service-owned signal: the operator's likes are high-trust
attention. The endpoint (hub) exposes recently-liked authors with sample
posts; phi filters out anyone she's already exchanged with and surfaces
the rest as warm leads — strangers worth considering, not cold outreach.

Coupling stays at the JSON contract: the source service owns the data
model and refresh, phi owns the per-consumer filter. Renderer is split
from fetch+filter so a future templating swap only touches `_render`.
