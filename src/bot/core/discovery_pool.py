"""[DISCOVERY POOL] — authors the operator has been liking lately.

The hub supplies recently liked authors and sample posts. Phi filters out
accounts she has already interacted with. Notification runs rank the remaining
samples against the incoming conversation; scheduled runs can browse the pool.
The samples are other people's writing and a signal of the operator's taste.

The rendered header identifies that source and asks for attribution rather
than copied sentences. Earlier humor coaching was removed from the header;
this module supplies material to notice, not a public speaking style.
