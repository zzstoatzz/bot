"""[RECENT OPERATIONS] — recent writes to Phi's own PDS.

The block combines durable repo events with a snapshot backfill over the
last 48 hours. Top-level posts include a bounded text preview and source
links so Phi can recognize subjects already covered. Replies and other
routine activity are tallied; edits and deletes retain row-level evidence
and process attribution. The renderer has a sanity cap and reports truncation.

Post previews are evidence of prior publication, not an instruction to keep
that style. An earlier prose-free version made repeated subjects harder to
recognize. Reducing this block must preserve that continuity and the external
edit/delete evidence. Source retrieval and rendered output are cached for five
minutes. `_summarize` owns per-collection formatting; `_render` owns the block.
