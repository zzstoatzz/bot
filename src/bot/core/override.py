"""[OPERATOR OVERRIDE] — safe mode, driven by a record on the operator's PDS.

The override is an ``io.zzstoatzz.phi.override`` record (rkey ``self``) on
the OPERATOR's repo — not phi's, and not a control-plane flag on the bot.
Repo ownership is the authorization: anyone can write this record to their
own repo, but the bot only reads ``settings.owner_did``'s copy. atproto's
own security model is the allowlist.

The active record is rendered into context and checked at MCP mutation and
native publication boundaries. Private operator delivery also observes it;
there is no PDS-note escape channel. Runtime pause and voice reset are separate.
See docs/safety.md for the actual action boundaries and their coverage.

Everything is public and inspectable — no hidden state, per the
no-big-brother principle. Reads go straight to the operator's PDS
(resolved from the DID document via plc.directory); no bluesky appview.

Freshness: short TTL cache. On fetch failure the last known state holds
(a PDS blip shouldn't flap safe mode in either direction); if we've never
successfully fetched, the override is treated as inactive — the bot can't
be bricked by an operator-PDS outage, and the supervised-resume flow
verifies the override is visibly active before resuming phi anyway.
