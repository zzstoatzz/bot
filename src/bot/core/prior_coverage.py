"""Prior-coverage recall — phi's own posts, keyed by what she's perceiving.

On 2026-08-05 22:02 and 2026-08-06 22:02 phi posted the same summary of the
same gracekind post, same link, because nothing in the system could answer
"have I ever said anything about this?" — her only self-record was a
10-row recency window, and her memory namespaces store observations about
*other people*. This module is the missing organ: a semantic index of her
own published posts, queried by content the moment it enters her context
(feed reads, searches, notification batches), so recall fires the way a
person's does — the sight of the material reminds her she already covered
it. The same lookup runs once more at posting time with the draft itself
as the query (bot/tools/posting.py → policy judge, `self-repeat`): on
2026-08-18 the perception-keyed pass fired on a whole feed blob and
surfaced five chicken-market posts while missing the two-day-old gerakines
post phi was about to restate. The draft is the one query that is exactly
the thing being checked.

Index lives in turbopuffer (phi-own-posts). Freshness has two halves:
- backfill (startup task): pages her PDS post collection, indexes anything
  newer than the /data watermark — covers history and downtime gaps.
- live: the jetstream ops-log consumer indexes each post create/update as
  it commits.
