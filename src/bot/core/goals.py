"""Phi's goals — durable anchors stored on PDS.

Each goal is a single record under `io.zzstoatzz.phi.goal`. Updates use
putRecord with the same rkey, so the goal evolves in place over time.
History is in the firehose if anyone wants it.

Mutation is gated at the tool layer (propose_goal_change) using the same
_is_owner check as follow_user — so phi can only change its own goals
when the owner has just liked an authorization-request post.
