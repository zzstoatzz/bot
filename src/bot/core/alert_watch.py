"""phi watches the operator's logfire alerts so the operator doesn't have to.

The raw alert channels on Discord are muted; phi polls logfire's alert API
across all the operator's projects and carries the churn as incidents. The
contract with the operator: anything genuinely needing their hands reaches
them as one @-mention per incident; everything else — flapping, self-resolved,
known-cause — is absorbed silently. Tuning observations accumulate in phi's
reflective surfaces, never as tags.

The unit of news is the incident, not the recurrence — doctrine inherited
from the retired prefect-specific workflow_failures monitor, whose job now
rides this path as the 'flow run failed' logfire alert.
