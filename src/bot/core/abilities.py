"""What each of phi's tools can cost if it goes wrong.

A tool without a risk declaration is not a valid tool — `tests/test_abilities.py`
fails on any registered tool missing an entry here, and on any entry that no
longer matches a real tool. That bijection is the point: the declaration cannot
drift from the code in either direction.

The shape is defined by `lexicons/io/zzstoatzz/phi/getAbilities.json` and served at
`/xrpc/io.zzstoatzz.phi.getAbilities`, so phi's own risk surface is public and
readable the same way any other atproto service publishes its capabilities.

Magnitude is ordered by **reach and reversibility**, never by how often a tool
gets used:

    none      reads only; changes nothing anywhere
    low       changes phi's own private state; reversible
    moderate  publicly visible under her name; reversible by her
    high      reaches other people's attention, spends real money, or cannot
              be undone with the tools she actually has

`reason` names the concrete failure, in one sentence. It is read by a person in
the cockpit and by the policy judge when it evaluates a proposed call — so
"could post something bad" is useless and "a reply lands in someone's
notifications and cannot be un-notified" is not.
