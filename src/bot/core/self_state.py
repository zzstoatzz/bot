"""[GOALS] + [INNER CRITIC] + [SELF STATE] — phi sees its compass, its own critique, and its operational pointers.

GOALS are intent: what phi is for. Stored on PDS as canonical state.
INNER CRITIC is friction: phi's own voice turned inward, noticing patterns
in her recent posts evaluated against the stated goals. Not a stranger,
not external — her own internal critic, owning the critique. Patterns to
push against, not maintain.
SELF STATE is operational: last follow, queue depth.

The haiku pass is *derived* (not duplicated state) and cached in memory:
1h TTL, invalidated when the latest post URI changes or goals change. The
whole compose is also block-cached at 5min so notification polls (10s)
don't hammer PDS.
