"""[GOALS] and the recent-posting inventory — two separately-consumed organs.

GOALS are intent: what phi is for. Stored on PDS as canonical state.
`get_state_block` renders them alone — one block, one purpose.

The posting inventory is a structured, third-person tally of what phi's
recent top-level posts have covered (subjects / people / mode). Compiled by a small dedicated agent; written deliberately plain.
It is NOT phi's voice — exemplar pressure beats abstract rules, so the
inventory itself must stay out of phi's register or it teaches the bad
voice it was meant to describe. `get_inventory_block` renders it; the
[SELF] block composes it next to phi's own self record so testimony and
measurement sit in one place (they were two separately-named blocks
until 2026-08-07, which read as sprawl because it was).

The inventory pass is *derived* (not duplicated state) and cached in
memory: 1h TTL, invalidated when the latest post URI changes. The goals
compose is block-cached at 5min so notification polls (10s) don't
hammer PDS.
