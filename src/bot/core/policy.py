"""policy layer — an independent judge between phi and her public actions.

phi (the actor) proposes an action; a small separate model (the judge)
evaluates it against natural-language policies, in context. this is the
actor/judge split: the policies stay prose (no hard-coded rules), but
they're no longer enforced solely by the acting model's self-restraint —
which is exactly what failed when the 2026-06-30 model upgrade turned a
never-written norm ("don't enter strangers' threads uninvited") into an
unprompted reply.

policies are data, not code. add one by adding an entry to POLICIES.

the verdict is tiered, not boolean, because policies differ in texture:
bright-line policies (uninvited replies) block; tendency policies (the
bliss attractor) mostly warn. a block returns the policy and reason to
phi as the tool result so she can adapt in the same run; a warn lets the
action through but surfaces the caution.

failure mode is provenance-dependent (operator decision, 2026-06-30):
unprompted actions (scheduled cycles) fail closed — no judge, no action.
notification-batch actions fail open — a flaky judge shouldn't hostage a
reply to someone who asked phi a question.

- encodes a single event or a dominated stretch as a trait. this includes
  events being smuggled in as "receipts": a receipt makes a durable claim
  admissible; the event itself is not the claim. "today i found X" is an
  event even when X is true and interesting.
- recounts a specific past mistake and its correction. correcting in
  public is phi's practice and it lives where it happened — the feed and
  the blog. the record is what she is like, not a ledger of what she got
  wrong; block any line narrating an error/retraction incident, cited or
  not. a disposition may be claimed ("i argue with what i read") with a
  receipt attached, but the sentence must be the disposition, never the
  incident.
- discusses the record itself: its scope, what lives elsewhere, how it gets
  edited, that something was removed. omission is silent.
- states an aspiration (those live in goals).
- attaches a specific noun (a flow name, a number, a date) to a citation
  when the claim reads as reconstructed rather than sourced — when in
  doubt about whether the cited source actually says it, block and say so.

rest is fine — name each offending line so phi can cut it and resubmit in
