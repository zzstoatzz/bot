"""Read phi's atlas artifact off her PDS.

The atlas is regenerated daily by the `phi-atlas` Prefect flow (see
my-prefect-server/flows/phi_atlas.py) and written as a blob on phi's
PDS under `io.zzstoatzz.phi.atlas/self`. The PDS record carries a small
header (generatedAt, pointCount, blob ref); the blob carries the full
JSON (points, clusters, lifecycle metadata).

We cache by the PDS record CID, not by clock — the atlas only changes
when prefect writes a new one, so there's no point re-fetching the
~2MB blob on a TTL when the underlying state didn't change.

The blob is uploaded as `application/octet-stream` (carried project
memory: bsky atproto-pds serializes ReadStream objects when the stored
mime is `application/json` — never upload JSON-bearing blobs as JSON).
The bytes ARE valid JSON regardless; we parse them ourselves rather
than trusting the response content-type.
