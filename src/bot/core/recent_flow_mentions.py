"""[RECENT FLOW MENTIONS] — prior posts about workflow state.

This specialized view was introduced when the global recent-operations block
had a ten-write cap and could lose a previous alert on busy days. The global
block now covers 48 hours with a sanity cap; its old ten-write limit is no
longer the reason for this module.

This view scans roughly 30 Bluesky posts for workflow-related subjects and
renders the matches for the workflow entry point. It is a narrower continuity
view intended to reduce repeated alerts; it is not a complete incident history.
