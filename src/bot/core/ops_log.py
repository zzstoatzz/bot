"""Durable log of phi's own repo operations, tailed from jetstream.

[RECENT OPERATIONS] used to be built from ``listRecords`` — a snapshot of
surviving state. A snapshot cannot show a delete (the record is simply
absent) and shows an edit only as its final text, indistinguishable from a
fresh create. Awareness of what happened to the repo needs the repo's
event log, so this module tails jetstream (server-side filtered to phi's
DID — bandwidth is only her own events) and appends every commit op to a
JSONL file on the fly volume.

Two consumers:
- ``read_ops`` — the [RECENT OPERATIONS] block renders from this window.
- post creates are forwarded to the own-posts index (prior-coverage
  recall) via the ``on_post`` callback, so the semantic index of phi's
  own output stays live rather than daily-stale.

Ops arriving here were made by *anyone* holding credentials — this
process, phi's hosted MCP tools, or an external service. Ops performed by
this process register themselves via ``record_local_write`` so the block
can distinguish "you did this here" from "this happened to your repo";
the unattributed remainder is exactly the signal that caught nothing
before (e.g. a backend rewriting cosmik collections with no phi-side
call).
