"""process_tool_call hooks for phi's MCP toolsets.

Two hooks live here: a structural guard on pdsx (refuses feed writes) and
an observational logger on semble (records library-write provenance).

pdsx guard: posting flows through the trusted tools (bot.tools.posting) —

that's where
the consent allowlist, the policy judge, and the operator override live. A
raw ``create_record``/``update_record`` into ``app.bsky.feed.*`` via pdsx
would bypass all three, which until 2026-06-30 was only a prompt rule.
This hook makes it structure: feed-collection writes through pdsx refuse
with a pointer to the trusted path. Every other pdsx capability — phi's
own custom collections, cosmik cards (her operator channel under an
override), profile records — passes through untouched.
