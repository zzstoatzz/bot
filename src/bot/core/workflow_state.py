"""[WORKFLOW STATE] — current state of the operator's workflow automation.

Deterministic per-deployment health, computed in Python from raw flow run
data. No LLM in the classification path.

History: an earlier version handed the run history to a haiku synth agent
and asked it to label each deployment healthy/broken/stuck/degraded. That
synth hallucinated — given a clear run-history with three successes after
a failure cluster, it still labeled the deployment "broken" and cited the
end-time of a successful run as "no successful run since X". Phi did the
right thing by trusting the block; the block was wrong. Now the
classification is pure Python (most-recent terminal-state per deployment)
so it cannot lie. Phi can still call the prefect_* tools for detail.

Naming is deliberately abstract — workflow tooling is prefect today;
tomorrow it could be anything else with the same surface.
