        and any thought-post hours that already happened. The fix: at startup,
        look at phi's recent top-level posts and infer which schedule slots
        have already been filled today.

        Heuristic (deliberately loose), all in operator-local time:
        - any top-level post made today (operator local) at or after
          daily_reflection_hour marks the daily reflection slot as done
        - any top-level post made today (operator local) during a
          thought_post_hours hour marks that hour as done

        This is approximate — phi makes top-level posts from many contexts
        besides scheduled reflections (e.g. agent replies that decided to go
        top-level). But the worst case of being approximate is that phi
        SKIPS a scheduled post that was actually a reply-shaped post — which
        is the safe failure mode (silence is fine, double-posting is not).
