"""Trusted posting tools — the only sanctioned path for phi to act on bluesky.

These tools are the side-effect layer of the agentic loop. They wrap
``bot_client`` operations with everything that needs to happen around a write:
mention-consent allowlists, reply-ref construction, memory writes, status
metrics, and grapheme-aware splitting (which lives in ``BotClient.create_post``).

The agent is told (in operational instructions) to use these tools instead of
raw atproto record tools via pdsx — the latter would bypass gating and could
accidentally tag arbitrary users via uncontrolled mention facets.

Target URIs for replies are verified by fetching the record; reactions
(likes, reposts) live in bot/core/mcp_guard.py as governed pdsx writes.
hallucinated URIs refuse cleanly. Posts already in the current notifications
batch short-circuit the fetch since their cid + author + thread root are
already loaded.

``post`` additionally runs through the pre-action policy judge
(``bot.core.policy``): an independent model reviews the proposed post plus its
provenance (invited vs unprompted) against phi's written policies and can
block or warn. The verdict comes back to phi as tool-result text so she can
adapt in the same run.
