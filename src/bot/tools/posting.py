"""Trusted posting tools — the only sanctioned path for phi to act on bluesky.

These tools are the side-effect layer of the agentic loop. They wrap
``bot_client`` operations with everything that needs to happen around a write:
mention-consent allowlists, reply-ref construction, memory writes, status
metrics, and grapheme-aware splitting (which lives in ``BotClient.create_post``).

The agent is told (in operational instructions) to use these tools instead of
the raw atproto record tools available via the pdsx MCP. The pdsx tools would
bypass the gating and could accidentally tag arbitrary users via uncontrolled
mention facets.

Each ``reply_to`` / ``like_post`` / ``repost_post`` call is scoped to URIs the
agent saw in its current notifications batch — the tool refuses to act on a URI
that isn't in ``ctx.deps.notifications_context``. This prevents the model from
hallucinating a target URI and posting somewhere unrelated.
