"""write_self — phi rewrites her own self record, through the owner gate.

Her goals are owner-gated (`propose_goal_change`); who she is was not. Until
2026-07-30 the self record was writable by raw `update_record`, which meant no
length cap, no `updatedAt` stamp, and no moment where anyone else saw the text
before it became the thing every bio rewrite and every run reads from.

The record stays hers to write, with operator authorization for the specific
rewrite. Private operator requests and existing public approval share the owner
gate; a private request does not need to be repeated publicly.
