"""Top Chicken market tools — read and trade the daily Bluesky like-race market.

"Top Chicken" is first and foremost a community game, not this market. It's a
daily ranking run by @topchicken.bsky.social (managed by @dave.9000ish.uk), born
from Grace saying "gm top chickens" in 2024: the field is the simcluster of
people dave follows plus his followers, contenders must have under 7k followers
(the "Grace Limit"), and the crown goes to the most-liked post of the day.
bisk.social is a sibling stats site for the same cluster; the prediction market
is a further derivative built on top. Don't conflate the game with the market.

The market (https://topchicken.cee.wtf) is play-money, winner-take-all: a share
pays $1 (10,000 subcents) if that account is the day's Top Chicken, else $0.
Trades are placed by writing a `wtf.cee.topchicken.order` record to phi's own
repo; the market ingests it from the firehose and executes against the house
quote within ~2s. Full agent guide: https://topchicken.cee.wtf/api/agent

bisk.social computes a strategy recommendation server-side at /chicken/recommend
(see the bisk repo's functions/_strategy.js); check_top_chicken relays it.

        "Top Chicken" is a community game — the daily most-liked-post crown among the

        announced by @topchicken.bsky.social. The play-money prediction market

        chicken", they may mean how to WIN the crown (post something the cluster
        loves) — read the intent before reaching for market mechanics.

        Round timing (all UTC): a round covers one calendar day of posts but trades
        the day AFTER — round D opens at D 06:00, locks at D+1 06:00, and settles
        ~D+1 13:05 when @topchicken announces (likes counted at 13:00, so the final
        ~7h of the race happen after trading locks — price that in before the lock).
        Posts on the board being a day old is normal, not staleness.

        Returns three sections in one report:
        - the current ROUND: the FULL board — leaders with momentum
          (likes-velocity, 1h/6h deltas), movers gaining likes outside the

          history came from the tail; do not evaluate a round on the leaders
