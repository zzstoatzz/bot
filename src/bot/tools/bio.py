"""Bio tool — phi rewrites her own bsky profile bio.

Lives as a tool on the main agent (rather than a separate `_bio_agent`)
specifically so phi has access to all the dynamic context blocks she'd
have during normal notification handling — `[OPERATOR]`, `[GOALS AND INTERESTS]`,
etc. without those, she falls back to training-
context guesses for things like the operator's handle, which produces
wrong-but-plausible text.

The 256-char cap is enforced structurally via `Annotated[str, Field(...)]`
on the tool parameter — pydantic refuses to dispatch the call if phi
overruns. Phi chooses when to rewrite it; startup preserves the current text.
