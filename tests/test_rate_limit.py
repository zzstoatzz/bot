"""The API rate limit is per client, and actually enforced.

2026-08-16: a scanner sent 593 requests across 497 paths in 40 seconds and
drew zero 429s. `default_limits` was declared on the Limiter but
SlowAPIMiddleware was never added, so only the two decorated routes were
enforced. Keying was also `get_remote_address` — behind fly's proxy that is
the proxy, one shared bucket for every caller (plyr.fm 8b9c0c05).
