"""A tool without a risk declaration is not a valid tool.

The point of these tests is the bijection: every registered tool has a
declaration, and every declaration names a real tool. Enforced in both
directions, a declaration cannot drift from the code — which is the failure
`/api/abilities` was built to fix once already, when the cockpit's
hand-curated `abilities.ts` fell out of sync with what phi could do.

The shape itself is defined by `lexicons/io/zzstoatzz/phi/getAbilities.json`;
these tests hold the code to that lexicon.
