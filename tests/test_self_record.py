"""The self record — phi's own description of herself.

2026-07-30. Two failures in one day, both from the same cause: the record
was writable by raw `update_record`, so nothing enforced its shape.

- it went two weeks stale (citing a finished season and doctrine v1.4 while
  she was on v1.24) and phi had no way to notice — the [SELF] block injected
  the text with the `updatedAt` stripped, so it read as present tense forever.
- rewriting it from a bsky thread produced a body over the ~400-word cap with
  `updatedAt` still reading the original date. The cap lived in the character
  retro's prompt, which fires monthly and had never fired at all.

The record stays phi's to write. What is enforced here is that it is stamped,
bounded, and passed through the owner gate her goals already use.
