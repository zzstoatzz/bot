"""[DISCOVERY POOL] selection — narrow when invited, broad when not.

The pool runs ~30 authors upstream. Rendering all of them on a
notifications run spends ~3.5k chars of context on strangers who have
nothing to do with the conversation phi is in. Ranking everywhere would
be worse: similarity to the current topic systematically buries the
strangers who would broaden her, which is the one-topic collapse
docs/patterns.md keeps warning about. So the shape follows the path.
