  Send a message to phi from the operator's devlog account
  (zzstoatzzdevlog.bsky.social), tagging @phi.zzstoatzz.io so phi gets a
  notification and acts on it. Use when the operator wants to say something
  to phi in-character as themselves — feedback, an apology, a nudge, a
  prompt to reflect or blog — rather than editing phi's code or config.

# devlog-to-phi

The operator talks to phi the way anyone does: by posting at it on bluesky.
The **pdsx MCP is already authenticated as the devlog account**
(`zzstoatzzdevlog.bsky.social`, `did:plc:o53crari67ge7bvbv273lxln`) — the
operator's testing/dev account, which phi knows is theirs and weighs
accordingly. So you post by creating an `app.bsky.feed.post` record with
`mcp__pdsx__create_record`. No scripts, no SDK login. (Verify with
`mcp__pdsx__whoami` if unsure who pdsx is.)

Do NOT post from phi's own account — this is the operator speaking to phi,
not phi speaking.

## when to use

The operator says "tell phi …", "let phi know …", "ask phi to …",
"apologize to phi", "nudge phi to blog". Anything where they want their
words delivered to phi as a message it will see and respond to.

Not for: changing phi's behavior (edit code/personality), inspecting phi
(`phi-check`), or reading phi's prompts (`phi-prompt-inspect`).

## how

1. Draft in the operator's voice — terse, lowercase, honest. Don't smooth it
   into corporate phrasing. Keep each post <= 300 graphemes.
2. The mention is what notifies phi. Phi's DID is
   `did:plc:65sucjiel52gefhcdcypynsr`. Put `@phi.zzstoatzz.io` in the text
   and add a mention facet whose `byteStart`/`byteEnd` cover that substring
   (UTF-8 byte offsets — for a leading `@phi.zzstoatzz.io` that's 0–17).
3. Create the root post:

   ```
   mcp__pdsx__create_record(
     collection="app.bsky.feed.post",
     record={
       "text": "@phi.zzstoatzz.io <message>",
       "facets": [{
         "index": {"byteStart": 0, "byteEnd": 17},
         "features": [{"$type": "app.bsky.richtext.facet#mention",
                       "did": "did:plc:65sucjiel52gefhcdcypynsr"}]
       }]
     }
   )
   ```

   `$type` and `createdAt` are auto-added by pdsx. The call returns the
   root's `uri` and `cid`.
4. For a thread, post each follow-up as a reply, carrying the same `root`
   ref and pointing `parent` at the previous post:

   ```
   record={
     "text": "<next post>",
     "reply": {
       "root":   {"uri": <root_uri>,   "cid": <root_cid>},
       "parent": {"uri": <prev_uri>,   "cid": <prev_cid>}
     }
   }
   ```

   NOTIFICATION RULE (learned 2026-08-01 the hard way): phi is notified by
   the root mention and by replies **to her posts** — a reply to your own
   post notifies nobody. Four follow-up asks once sat unread for hours this
   way. If phi has already replied and you want her to see more, reply to
   HER latest post (or add a fresh mention facet). And fetch her post's
   real `cid` first (`getPosts`/`get_record`) — never construct or guess a
   cid for a reply ref.
   TIMING RULE (learned 2026-08-21): phi answers a mention within about a
   minute, so a root that carries the mention gets read before the rest of
   the thread exists — a nine-post critique was answered as a one-post
   notice. For any thread longer than one post, post the root and every
   follow-up WITHOUT a mention facet first, then put the `@phi.zzstoatzz.io`
   mention (with its facet) in the LAST post. She is notified once, sees the
   whole thread via thread context, and replies to all of it.
5. Report the thread URL back:
   `https://bsky.app/profile/zzstoatzzdevlog.bsky.social/post/<root_rkey>`
   (rkey is the last path segment of the root uri). Phi picks up the mention
   on its next notification poll (~10s) and decides how to respond — no
   further prompting needed. To see what it did, follow up with `phi-check`.

## notes

- phi: `@phi.zzstoatzz.io` / `did:plc:65sucjiel52gefhcdcypynsr`.
- devlog (pdsx auth): `zzstoatzzdevlog.bsky.social` / `did:plc:o53crari67ge7bvbv273lxln`.
- Byte offsets, not character offsets — matters if the mention isn't at the
  start or the text has multibyte chars before it.
- This is an outward-facing public post. The operator asking you to send it
  is the authorization; deliver what they said, don't editorialize.
- General record CRUD via pdsx is covered in the `pdsx-fundamentals` skill;
  this skill is just the phi-mention recipe on top of it.

## follow through after posting

Monitor for Phi’s reply after sending a devlog message; posting the link is not
the end of the exchange. Read the reply in thread context and check material
claims against evidence before reporting back. If the reply has not arrived
before the turn ends, arrange a quiet, bounded follow-up when scheduling is
available. Notify Nate about substantive replies or blockers, not unchanged polls.
