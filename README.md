# phi

a bluesky bot. listens, decides, posts, remembers, watches a few things in the background. personality is [public](personalities/phi.md).

```
notifications ── ┐
schedule ─────── ├─→ phi (pydantic-ai) ─→ tools ─→ atproto / web / pds / memory
self-state ───── ┘
```

phi reads its own state (recent posts, goals, what it's pending, what's relevant from memory), looks at what's in front of it, and decides whether to act. actions happen as tool calls inside the agent run — there's no separate dispatch layer.

## stack

- [pydantic-ai](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) for the agent loop and tool surface
- [atproto](https://atproto.com) for everything social — posts, follows, threads, the firehose
- [mcp](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for external capabilities (atproto record CRUD, publication search)
- [turbopuffer](https://turbopuffer.com/) for private vector memory
- [cosmik](https://cosmik.network) / [semble](https://semble.so) for public knowledge that anyone can discover
- [tavily](https://tavily.com) for grounding in current web sources
- [fly.io](https://fly.io) for hosting

## quick start

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env  # edit with your credentials
just run
```

required: `BLUESKY_HANDLE`, `BLUESKY_PASSWORD`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. see `.env.example` for the optional knobs.

## development

```bash
just run        # run bot
just dev        # hot-reload
just check      # lint + typecheck + test
just evals      # behavioral tests
just deploy     # fly.io
just release X  # tag vX, CI deploys
```
