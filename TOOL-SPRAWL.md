# tool sprawl

surfacing the agent's tool catalogue in the UI made the sprawl visible. the
cockpit's `tools` lens currently lists ~30 tools across 9 source modules and
the categorization is incoherent. flagging this so it can be addressed at
the source — the UI just renders what's there.

## inventory (current)

| module | tools |
|---|---|
| `tools/memory.py` | `recall`, `note` |
| `tools/posting.py` | `reply_to`, `like_post`, `repost_post` |
| `tools/search.py` | `search_posts`, `search_network`, `web_search`, `get_trending` |
| `tools/bluesky.py` | `post`, `get_own_posts`, `check_urls`, `manage_labels`, `manage_mentionable`, `check_services`, `check_relays`, `changelog` |
| `tools/feeds.py` | `create_feed`, `list_feeds`, `delete_feed`, `read_timeline`, `read_feed`, `follow_user` |
| `tools/goals.py` | `list_goals`, `propose_goal_change` |
| `tools/observations.py` | `observe`, `drop_observation` |
| `tools/blog.py` | `list_blog_posts`, `publish_blog_post` |

**removed**: `tools/cosmik.py` (`save_url`, `create_connection`) — these are now
covered by the `cosmik-records` skill. phi loads it on demand and uses
`mcp__pdsx__create_record` to write `network.cosmik.*` records of the right
shape, instead of going through per-record-type tool wrappers.

## concrete misplacements that jump out

1. **`post` lives in `bluesky.py` but `reply_to` / `like_post` / `repost_post` live in `posting.py`.** these are the same shape of action — write to bluesky. one of those modules can absorb the other.
2. **`follow_user` is in `feeds.py`.** following is a graph operation, not a feed operation. it has nothing to do with the graze-feeds cluster (`create_feed` / `list_feeds` / `delete_feed` / `read_feed` / `read_timeline`). it should move.
3. **`note`, `save_url`, `create_connection` are all "create a cosmik record"** but split across `memory.py` and `cosmik.py`. they should be one cluster.
4. **`memory.py` has just `recall` + `note`.** `note` is half memory and half cosmik write — picking one home would be cleaner.
5. **`manage_labels` and `manage_mentionable` are in `bluesky.py`** but they're operator-only self-management of phi's identity boundaries — they belong with `goals` / `observations` (other operator-gated identity stuff) or in their own `self.py`.
6. **`check_urls` is in `bluesky.py`.** it's a generic URL HEAD request — nothing bluesky about it.
7. **`check_services`, `check_relays`, `changelog` are scattered across `bluesky.py`** but they're a coherent monitoring cluster — distinct from posting.
8. **`feeds.py` mixes graze CRUD (`create_feed`, `delete_feed`) with reading (`read_timeline`, `read_feed`, `list_feeds`).** different lifecycles, probably worth splitting.
9. **`list_blog_posts` is a registered agent tool AND `blog.py` is also where the `publish-blog` skill body lives.** skill vs tool overlap on the same surface area is confusing.

## scale

30 tools is a lot. each adds JSON-schema + docstring to every prompt phi
runs. some of these probably want consolidation (e.g. `like_post` /
`repost_post` / `reply_to` / `follow_user` could be a single `engage` tool
with a kind parameter, depending on whether the agent benefits from the
parameter-shape distinction).

## what the UI actually wants from the bot

the cockpit currently hand-syncs `web/src/lib/abilities.ts` with what's in
the source. that drifts the moment a tool is added/renamed/moved. proposed
backend endpoint:

```
GET /api/abilities

[
  {
    "name": "recall",
    "module": "memory",
    "doc": "search private memory for past conversations or things i know about people.",
    "operator_only": false,
    "category": "..." // if you decide on real categories upstream, expose them here
  },
  ...
]
```

this lets the UI show ground truth (real names, real docstrings, real
operator-gated flag) instead of hand-curated copy. i (the UI side) was
inventing category names + first-person verb framings that have no basis
in the source — that won't happen again, but the structural fix is
exposing this metadata properly so there's nothing to invent.

## skills

`pydantic-ai-skills` are a different thing from agent tools (load-on-demand
SKILL.md packs vs. always-available `@agent.tool` functions). they were
mixed into the same UI surface because i conflated them; that's been
removed. with only one skill (`publish-blog`) there's no UI surface for
them right now. when there are more, the cleanest cockpit integration is
probably as a kind on the `mind` lens — skills as objects phi can pull
into attention, alongside observations/goals — rather than a separate
lens. flagging for when the catalogue grows.

## suggested order of operations

1. expose `/api/abilities` (introspect the agent's registered tools, grab
   docstrings, expose `module` + `operator_only`). this unblocks the UI
   from hand-curation.
2. consolidate the obvious misplacements above (8 specific moves).
3. consider consolidation of fine-grained engagement tools (`like_post` /
   `repost_post` / `reply_to` / `follow_user`) into one `engage(kind, ...)`
   tool — only worth it if the agent isn't actively benefiting from the
   shape distinction.
4. resolve the `blog.py` tool/skill overlap.

step 1 alone makes the UI honest. steps 2–4 reduce the surface area phi
has to think about every prompt.
