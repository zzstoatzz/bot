# cockpit (internal)

> **internal** — operator-facing surface. committed publicly like
> everything else, but not part of phi's advertised interface; expect
> rough edges and no stability promises.

the sveltekit app in `web/` (svelte 5, adapter-static), served by the
fastapi process at [phi.zzstoatzz.io](https://phi.zzstoatzz.io). pure
SPA: `ssr`/`prerender` disabled globally, unknown routes fall back to
`index.html` server-side and a styled `+error.svelte` client-side.

## surfaces

| route | what |
|---|---|
| `/` | HUD: identity, status pill (from `/health`), lens cycler (mind map / constellation), counts. ⌘K palette searches any network identity (typeahead.waow.tech) and opens the logbook drawer showing what phi knows about them (`/api/users/{handle}`) |
| `/docket` | daily promotion candidates from the docket flow |
| `/capabilities` | phi's registered tools, from `/api/abilities` (ground truth, not hand-curated) |
| `/market` | phi's top chicken market book: current position (with round context), all-time p&l + net-worth sparkline banded by market round, trade ledger with settlement outcomes and profile links. reads topchicken.cee.wtf via the bot's `/api/chicken/*` proxy (upstream has no CORS headers) |
| `/operator` | **operator override editor** — atproto OAuth login, write your `io.zzstoatzz.phi.override` record, see the live state phi obeys. see [../safety.md](../safety.md). below it, the **prompt cache** readout (`/api/cache`): one stacked bar per recent run — tokens read from cache / written at a premium / paid in full — plus collapse flags. public read, no auth |

`OverrideBanner` renders cockpit-wide when the operator's override is
active (public read of the record, ~60s cadence), linking to `/operator`.

The context panel distinguishes the cached base-context composition from
provider-measured usage in the runs included in that snapshot. The base
composition excludes task prompts and per-run blocks; it is not the full
starting context of a real run. Refresh failures leave the previous snapshot
visible with an explicit failure message. The operator form keeps its own
account-ownership rules regardless of the displayed usage data.

## oauth notes

- browser flow (`@atproto/oauth-client-browser`), doodl's house pattern:
  static client metadata at `/oauth-client-metadata.json`, granular
  scope (`repo:io.zzstoatzz.phi.override?action=create&action=update`),
  `slingshot.microcosm.blue` for handle resolution. no bsky appview.
- **authz is repo ownership**: anyone can sign in and write the record
  to their own repo; the bot only reads the operator's (`owner_did`).
- localhost dev uses the atproto loopback client (metadata derived from
  the `client_id` query string; no hosted doc needed).
- historical trap: PDSes older than atproto PR #5147 (2026-06-25)
  reject same-site OAuth clients (`Sec-Fetch-Site: same-site`), which
  bites here because the cockpit and the operator's PDS share
  `zzstoatzz.io`. the operator's PDS runs a patched image — see
  `pds-infra`.

## dev

```bash
cd web && bun install && bun run dev   # vite proxies /api/* to the python server
bun run check                          # svelte-check
```

the docker build compiles `web/` in a bun stage and the fastapi app
mounts `web/build/` at `/` (see `src/bot/main.py` "frontend mount" for
the routing layering — explicit routes, then static, then SPA fallback).

## Exchange inspection

The user-view endpoint returns up to five recent stored reply pairs
alongside the exchange count, with original content, storage timestamp, and
source URIs. The detail drawer renders those rows and links to source posts.
`recent_interactions: null` means the read failed or the serving API lacks
this field; an empty array means that read succeeded with no rows. Legacy
rows without source URIs remain visible and identify their missing links.
This is bounded reply-pair history, not a complete encounter timeline.
